## **General Project Guidelines**

To ensure consistency and comprehensiveness across all projects, here are some **common guidelines and best practices** your students should follow:

### **1. Form Validation with JavaScript Regex**
- **Registration and Login Forms:**
  - Validate email formats, password strength (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of numbers/special characters).
- **Data Entry Forms:**
  - Ensure fields like dates, numbers (e.g., transaction amounts, flight numbers), and text inputs meet specified patterns.
- **Error Messaging:**
  - Provide real-time feedback to users on invalid inputs.

### **2. Asynchronous Operations with `async/await`**
- **Fetch API:**
  - Use `async/await` for all client-server communication.
  - Handle loading states and errors gracefully.
- **File Operations on Server:**
  - Implement `async` functions for reading from and writing to JSON files.
  - Ensure data consistency and handle potential file access errors.

### **3. RESTful API Design**
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**
  - Use clear and consistent endpoint names (e.g., `/api/users`, `/api/tasks`).
- **HTTP Methods:**
  - Use GET for data retrieval, POST for creation, PUT/PATCH for updates, and DELETE for removals.
- **Status Codes:**
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes for success and error scenarios.

### **4. Data Management**
- **JSON File Structure:**
  - Organize data logically within JSON files (e.g., separate files for users, tasks, etc.).
- **Concurrency Handling:**
  - Ensure that simultaneous file operations do not corrupt data (consider using file locks or atomic operations if applicable).

### **5. Security Considerations**
- **Password Handling:**
  - Hash passwords before storing them (even if using JSON files).
- **Input Sanitization:**
  - Prevent injection attacks by sanitizing all user inputs.
- **Session Management:**
  - Securely manage user sessions or tokens to protect authenticated routes.

### **6. User Experience**
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure applications are accessible and functional across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Intuitive Navigation:**
  - Design clear navigation paths for users to access different features.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:**
  - Provide users with feedback on their actions (e.g., confirmations, error messages).

### **7. Documentation and Presentation**
- **Code Documentation:**
  - Encourage commenting and clear code organization for maintainability.
- **Project Presentation:**
  - Prepare a demo showcasing key features, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
- **README File:**
  - Include setup instructions, project descriptions, and any other relevant information.
